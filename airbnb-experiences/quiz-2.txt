1. What does the `.map()` array method do?
   - Takes a callback function as a parameter and returns a new
   array. Whatever gets returned from the callback function provided
   is placed at the same index in the new array. Usually we take the items 
   from the original array and modify them in some way.

2. What do we usually use `.map()` for in React?
   - Convert an array of raw data into an array of JSX elements
   taht can be displayed on the page.


3. Why is using `.map()` better than just creating the components
   manually by typing them out?
   - It is a lot more DRY to use `.map()`. Also makes our code more 
   "self-sustaining"- not requiring additional changes whenever the 
   data changes
