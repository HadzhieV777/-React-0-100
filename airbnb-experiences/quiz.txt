1. What do props help us accomplish?

 - Props make a component more reusable.


2. How do you pass a prop into a component?

 - <MyCustomHeader title="..."/>


3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. 'blahblah={true}') to a native
DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblah={true}>) Why or Why not?

 - No, because the JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will
 be turned into REAL DOM elements by React. And real DOM elements only
 have the properties/attributes specified in the HTML specification.
 (Which doesn't include properties like blahblah). 


4. How to receive props in a component?

- Passed to a component, named props by strong convention.
function Navbar(props) {
    return (
        <header>
           ...
        </header>
    )
}


5. What data type is 'props' when the component receives it?

- An Object!
