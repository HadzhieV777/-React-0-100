1. Why do we need to "import React from react" in our files?
-React is what defines JSX

2. If console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
-A JS Object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us.


3.What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
- "Declarative" - I can tell the computer WHAT to do and expect 
it to handle the details.
- "Imperative" - I need to tell the computer HOW to do each step

4. What does it meant for something to be "composable"?
- We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger.
