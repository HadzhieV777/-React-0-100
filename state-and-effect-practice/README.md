# CSS states

- The :hover state becomes present when a user hovers over a button, by bringing their mouse or trackpad over it, without selecting it or clicking on it.

- To make the change less sudden, pair :hover with the transition property.

- The transition property will help make the transition from no state to a :hover state much smoother.

- The :focus state takes effect for keyboard users - specifically it will activate when you focus on a button by hitting the Tab key (â‡¥).

- The :hover state styles are applied before clicking when I hover over the button.

- The :focus state styles are applied also, because when a button is clicked it also gains a :focus state alongside an :active one.

- However, keep in mind that they are not the same thing.

- :focus state is when an element is being focused on and :active is when a user clicks on an element by holding and pressing down on it.

- To change the style for when a user clicks a button, apply styles to the :active CSS pseudoselector.
